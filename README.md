# The Dactyl-ManuForm Keyboard:
# Opposable Thumb Edition

This, the DMOTE, is a fork of the [Dactyl-ManuForm](https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard),
a parametrized, split-hand, concave, columnar, ergonomic keyboard. In this fork,
the thumb cluster has been modified to minimize shearing forces.

By cloning this repository and editing fairly simple parameter files you can
adjust the following to taste:

* The size and shape of the key matrix
* Row and column curvature
* Row tilt (tenting)
* Column tilt
* Height
* Exceptions (tilt and placement) for columns and individual keys
* Whether to include minor features: LED strips etc.
